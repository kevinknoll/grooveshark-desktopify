Grooveshark Desktopify
======================

Overview
--------
Grooveshark Desktopify lurks silently in the water, waiting for you to visit a Grooveshark.com link. When it sees a matching link, it prompts you to either open the link with the Grooveshark Desktop app or continue on as normal.

Why?
----
Currently when you have the Grooveshark Desktop app open and click on a Grooveshark.com link that someone shared with you (either via instant message, email, Facebook, Twitter, etc), you end up with two Grooveshark sessions (one in the browser, one in the app). This is annoying because you end up having to either pause the desktop app to handle the browser or navigate to the link manually in the desktop app). This is where Grooveshark Desktopify comes in, allowing you to easily redirect the browser tab down into the desktop app (if you so choose).

How?
----
Leverages the Grooveshark protocol (http://grooveshark.wikia.com/wiki/Grooveshark_Protocol_%28gs://%29)
